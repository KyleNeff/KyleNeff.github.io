          This project involved developing an <b>Android</b> poker tracking app using <b>Java</b> and <b>Android SDK</b>. The app is designed to track and manage poker sessions, allowing users to input session details such as time, stakes, and results. With a focus on usability, the interface offers an intuitive experience for users to log and monitor their poker activity seamlessly.
          <br><br>
          One of the core features is <b>real-time</b> profit calculation, where the app dynamically updates users' overall profits or losses based on session data. This feature gives players instant insights into their performance across multiple sessions. Additionally, session management tools enable users to track specific game types, dates, and locations for a detailed history of their poker activity.
          <br><br>
          <b>Data persistence</b> was implemented to ensure that users' session information is stored securely and remains accessible across app launches. By leveraging the Android SDK's built-in storage mechanisms, the app maintains consistent performance and reliability, providing users with a robust tool to track their poker progress over time.
