            This project focuses on developing a <b>Mars rover pathfinding tool</b> that calculates <b>optimal navigation routes</b> and <b>visualizes them in 3D</b>. The backend was built in <b>Python</b> and handles <b>Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files</b>, processing the terrain data to create accurate representations of the Martian surface. The pathfinding system uses the <b>A* algorithm</b> for known terrains, offering an efficient and fast solution to calculate optimal paths. For unknown terrains, we developed a <b>custom exploration algorithm</b> that allows the rover to navigate expansive areas with limited visibility and memory, dynamically adapting to obstacles and terrain changes.
            <br><br>
            On the frontend, we utilized <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>Three.js</b> to render the Martian landscape and animate the rover’s path in real-time. The visualization takes the processed DEM data and converts it into a detailed 3D topographic model, allowing users to see elevation changes and the rover’s route with precision. The rover’s path is brought to life with animations, and users can control the simulation through fast-forward, rewind, and pause options. Free-view exploration is also available, allowing users to observe the landscape and the rover’s journey from different angles.

            As part of the visualization team, my role focused on developing the 3D visualization and animation for the Mars rover pathfinding tool. I was responsible for creating the detailed terrain visualization using Three.js, where I transformed DEM data into a topographic model of the Martian landscape. I also designed and implemented the animation of the rover's path, ensuring smooth transitions and interactive controls such as fast-forward, rewind, and pause. This allowed users to experience the rover’s journey in real-time, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of the tool.
